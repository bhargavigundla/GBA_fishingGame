**My Fishing Game!**

Hello! Welcome to my(Bhargavi's) fishing game. Personally, I would have wanted to fish for some cuter fishies, 
but calculating object collision with non-rectangular objects was kinda something I didn't have time to implement.
Please use your imagination for this game! 

You're just trying to catch fish here! Right now, you can only catch about 999 fish max. Actuully, maybe you can catch more.
But that would definitely be a bug. 


**To Play:**

To play, press start.
Once you're in the game, press start to pause, and unpause.
When you inevitably lose(unless you wind up catching that 999th fish), press start to return to the menu.
(Can you sense the pattern here with the buttons?)


**Controls:**

You control the fishing hook with the four arrow keys to move around and catch as many fish as you can!


**Types of Fishies**

Solid fish: SAFE, and increments score
Two-toned fish: DANGER

Catching a Two-Toned Fish(TTF) will end the game! So try to avoid those, please.


**Miscellaneous**

Try pressing the A button while playing! It makes the game a little more fun:)

Sometimes, you might die the second you start the game. 
      This is because fishies randomely spawn on the screen, 
      and sometimes the bad fishies spawn at the sme location as your fishing hook!
